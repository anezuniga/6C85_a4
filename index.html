		<h2>Proposition: Access to Abortion Services is a Critical Health and Rights Issue for Women in the US</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose a gradient of orange for the visualization (score: 1). I wanted to use a color that conveys urgency without the alarmist connotation of red. The color gradient progresses from a near-white to a deep orange, which was deliberate to maintain contrast with the background and draw attention without using an aggressive color like red.</li>
				<li>Scale extent to 100% (score: 0.5). I extended the scale to 100% even though one state nearly reaches that mark at 99%. This design decision helps to underscore the critical nature of the issue by showing that a significant portion of the population in some states is affected, making the visualization more persuasive.</li>
				<li>Many states are represented in a relatively dark shade (score: 1). The shades stand out against the lighter background, which effectively draws the reader's eye to areas of concern. It's an honest approach to emphasize the data without overrepresenting it.</li>
				<li>The data source is cited at the bottom (score: 2). I included this to enhance the credibility of the information and for informing readers where the data originates from.</li>
				<li>An engaging title was chosen (score: 2). I picked a title that would immediately draw the reader in and prompt them to consider the implications of the data presented. "State-by-State: Tracking Travel for Abortion Services" is both engaging and describes what the visualization is about.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="con.png" alt="Map showing the decrease in abortion clinics across the U.S." />
				<figcaption>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Color palette selection (score: -0.5). I chose a dark green color palette to present the changes subtly. The goal was to make the decrease in clinics not overly prominent, implying that while numbers have decreased, it doesn't necessarily indicate an alarming situation. This choice could suggest that the need for clinics has diminished, aligning the clinic availability with current demands.</li>
				<li>Non-linear color scale (score: -1.5). I used a non-linear color scale, which could be considered somewhat deceptive. It was intended to mute the visual impact of the decrease in clinics. This scale makes the overall map look mostly dark green, which visually suggests that the decrease is a general trend and not specific to certain areas, potentially downplaying the impact of clinic closures on access to services.</li>
				<li>Data source inclusion (score: 2). I included the data source to establish credibility and provide viewers with the context for the data presented. This earnest decision was made to ensure transparency and to allow the viewer to verify the source of the information.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>In constructing these visualizations, I found the selection of data to support each side of the argument rather straightforward. The data itself naturally lent distinct narratives; some metrics clearly highlighted the urgency and need for accessible abortion services, while others could be interpreted to suggest a decrease in demand or need for such services. However, formulating the overarching questions that would be addressed by each visualization was challenging. It required a nuanced understanding of the implications of each data set and how they could be presented to support contrasting viewpoints.</p>

	  <p>What surprised me the most was the significant role of color gradients in the perception of the data, or in general deceptive techniques. The manipulation of the color scale, its range, and intensity had a profound effect on the message conveyed by the map towards a specific interpretation of the data.</p>

	  <p>I have come to define "ethical analysis and visualization" as the practice of presenting data in a manner that is truthful, transparent, and considerate of the audience's ability to interpret the information accurately. Ethical visualization respects the viewer's intelligence and their right to form an informed opinion, while unethical visualization seeks to manipulate their perception, potentially leading to misinformed conclusions.</p>

	  <p>I think the boundary between "acceptable" persuasive choices and "misleading" ones is nuanced and often lies in the intent behind the visualization. Acceptable persuasion educates and enlightens, providing clarity without distortion. Misleading tactics, however, intentionally obfuscate or exaggerate to provoke a specific reaction or belief.</p>
